## Features

- **Staff control** 
- **Punishment control**
- **Status from your server**

## How it works

As soon as a staff member joins the server, their time online is going to be logged
 into a file, when they disconnect a simple embed will be sent in a defined Discord
 channel, with the amount of time they where online.

When a punishment to a player occurs, an embed will be sent in a predefined channel
 on Discord, with all the information.

Another feature built-in is the .status command wich pings your defined server, in
 order to retrieve information such as the server icon, the amount of players online 
 and the latency.
